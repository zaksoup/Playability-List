#Playability List
##About Playability List
Playability started out as a final project for my sophomore computer science class in high school. I’ve played around with it a bit since then but ultimately I’ve come to the decision that playability in it’s current form is not what my dream for playability is, and it never will be.
That being said, I’m renaming this version of Playbility to Playability List and releasing it for anybody to install and run on their own servers.
##Requirements
* PHP
* MongoDB
* The PHP MongoDB PECL Extension
* Bravery

##Installation
These instructions make the assumption that you already have Mongo running locally, or you know how to connect to an instance of Mongo remotely. They also assume that you are cloning to a folder that apache can serve PHP files from.

1. Clone
2. navigate to `[Playability List directory]/install` and follow all instructions
3. navigate to `[Playability List directory]/login` and log in
4. others can view your list simply by visiting the directory you have playability list running from.
